            <p>Weddings are one of the most emotionally charged events in anyone's life, and in Lagos, they're
                celebrated with a grandeur and vibrancy that few cities can match. From elegant beach ceremonies at
                Elegushi to lavish receptions in Victoria Island's finest venues, Lagos weddings are spectacles worth
                capturing from every possible angle — including from the sky.</p>

            <p>Drone footage has become the defining element that separates standard wedding videos from truly cinematic
                productions. Here are the 10 essential drone shots that every wedding video should include, along with
                specific tips for executing them in Lagos locations.</p>

            <h2>1. The Venue Reveal</h2>
            <p>Start your footage with a dramatic wide shot that slowly reveals the entire wedding venue. The drone
                begins high and distant, then sweeps in toward the decorated venue, giving viewers a sense of scale and
                grandeur. For beach weddings at Elegushi or Tarkwa Bay, start over the ocean and fly inland to reveal
                the setup. For indoor venues like Balmoral Convention Centre, orbit the exterior at golden hour to
                capture the building and arriving guests.</p>

            <p>This shot works best when the venue is fully decorated but before guests arrive — the empty, pristine
                setup creates a "magazine shoot" aesthetic that couples adore.</p>

            <h2>2. The Processional Tracking Shot</h2>
            <p>Follow the bridal procession from above as it moves from the church to the reception. In Lagos, this
                often means capturing the convoy along iconic routes like the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge or Third Mainland
                Bridge. The drone flies parallel to the vehicles at a consistent altitude, creating a dynamic,
                movie-like sequence that establishes the journey between venues.</p>

            <p>This shot requires careful coordination with the driver and a drone with long battery life, as the
                distance can be significant depending on the route.</p>

            <h2>3. The Overhead Dance Floor</h2>
            <p>Position the drone directly above the dance floor during the reception's most energetic moments. From
                this bird's-eye perspective, the swirl of colourful aso-ebi outfits, the choreagraphed dance routines,
                and the circular crowd formations create mesmerising, kaleidoscopic patterns. This shot is uniquely
                aerial — no ground-level camera can replicate it.</p>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <h4>💡 Technical Tip</h4>
                <p>Use a slow shutter speed (1/30 to 1/60) for the overhead dance floor shot to create a subtle motion
                    blur that conveys energy and movement. Keep the drone at a safe distance — at least 10 metres above
                    the crowd — and ensure obstacle avoidance is enabled.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. The Couple's Portrait Orbit</h2>
            <p>When the couple steps away for portrait photos, execute a slow, gentle orbit around them. The drone
                circles at a 30-45 degree downward angle, keeping the couple centred while the background rotates
                beautifully. For Lagos weddings, position the couple near water (lagoon, pool, or beach) or against a
                striking architectural backdrop for maximum effect.</p>

            <p>This 15-30 second shot often becomes the hero moment of the highlight reel — the one clip that the couple
                shares repeatedly on Instagram.</p>

            <h2>5. The Guest Arrival Overview</h2>
            <p>Capture a time-compressed aerial view of guests arriving. The drone hovers at a fixed position above the
                entrance, showing the flow of beautifully dressed guests walking toward the venue. At Nigerian weddings,
                the variety of outfits, colours, and accessories makes this shot particularly vibrant and engaging.</p>

            <h2>6. The Sunset Silhouette</h2>
            <p>If the wedding schedule allows, position the drone behind the couple at sunset so they're silhouetted
                against the glowing sky. This works spectacularly on Lagos beaches, where the Atlantic sunset provides a
                palette of oranges, pinks, and purples. The drone should be low — just 3-5 metres above the couple — to
                capture the wide horizon with them as small, intimate figures against the vast sky.</p>

            <h2>7. The Table Setup Sweep</h2>
            <p>Before guests sit down for the reception, fly the drone slowly over the table arrangements. The overhead
                perspective reveals the full table layout, floral arrangements, place settings, and decorative details
                that hours of effort have produced. Wedding planners particularly love this shot as portfolio material.
            </p>

            <h2>8. The Crowd Reaction Pull-Back</h2>
            <p>During key moments — the first kiss, the first dance, the cake cutting — position the drone close to the
                crowd, then rapidly pull back and rise to reveal the entire guest assembly reacting. This "pull-back"
                creates a dramatic scale shift from intimate to epic that amplifies the emotion of the moment.</p>

            <h2>9. The Exit Send-Off</h2>
            <p>As the couple departs the venue at the end of the night, capture their exit from above. Whether they're
                leaving in a decorated car, walking through a sparkler send-off, or being showered with confetti, the
                aerial perspective adds a fairy-tale quality to the closing moments. Follow the departing vehicle
                briefly as it drives away for a cinematic ending.</p>

            <h2>10. The Full Grounds Establishing Shot</h2>
            <p>At the highest comfortable altitude, capture a wide shot that shows the entire venue, parking, gardens,
                and surrounding area. This establishing shot is usually placed at the beginning of the highlight reel to
                set the scene, or used as a transition between ceremony and reception footage. It gives viewers the "big
                picture" context that makes all the close-up shots more meaningful.</p>

            <blockquote>A wedding happens once, but great aerial footage makes the memories eternal. The couples who
                invest in drone coverage consistently say it was the best decision of their wedding planning — the
                footage captures the scale, energy, and emotion in ways that ground cameras simply cannot.</blockquote>

            <h2>Planning Your Wedding Drone Coverage</h2>

            <h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>
            <p>Coordinate closely with the wedding planner and photographer to identify the exact moments when drone
                coverage will be most impactful. Create a shot list in advance and time each flight window so the drone
                is in the air during key moments rather than hovering needlessly.</p>

            <h3>Respect the Ceremony</h3>
            <p>Drones can be noisy. During quiet, intimate moments — especially during vows and prayers — keep the drone
                high enough that the buzzing doesn't distract. Or better yet, get the venue establishing shots before
                the ceremony starts and save the closer footage for the reception when music and conversation mask the
                drone sound.</p>

            <h3>Weather Contingency</h3>
            <p>Lagos weather is unpredictable, especially during rainy season (April to October). Have a backup plan for
                drone coverage. If outdoor flight isn't possible, focus on interior shots for critical moments and plan
                to capture outdoor aerial footage during any weather breaks.</p>

            <h3>Hire a Professional Pilot</h3>
            <p>Wedding drone coverage is not the time for amateur flying. An experienced pilot can execute complex shots
                safely while the photographer focuses on ground coverage. At PanoptesDrones, our pilots have extensive
                experience covering Lagos weddings and know how to work seamlessly alongside photo and video teams
                without getting in their way.</p>
