            <p>Drone flying is an exhilarating experience, but it comes with real responsibilities. A consumer drone is
                not a toy — it's a sophisticated piece of technology that weighs up to a kilogram and can fly at speeds
                exceeding 60 km/h. A crash can damage property, injure bystanders, or destroy your expensive equipment.
                The good news is that the vast majority of drone accidents are entirely preventable through proper
                preparation, awareness, and disciplined flying habits.</p>

            <p>This guide covers the essential safety practices that every beginner drone pilot must understand before
                taking their first flight.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Flight Safety Checklist</h2>

            <p>Professional pilots — manned and unmanned — never skip their pre-flight checklist. This disciplined
                approach catches potential failures before they become airborne emergencies. Here's the checklist every
                drone pilot should complete before every single flight:</p>

            <h3>Equipment Inspection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Propellers:</strong> Inspect all propellers for cracks, chips, warping, or loose fittings.
                    Even a tiny crack can cause a propeller to shatter mid-flight, resulting in an uncontrolled crash.
                    Replace any damaged propellers immediately — they're inexpensive compared to crash repairs.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery condition:</strong> Check for swelling, dents, or damage to the battery casing. A
                    swollen LiPo battery is a fire hazard and must never be used. Verify that battery contacts are clean
                    and free of debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery charge:</strong> Ensure the flight battery is fully charged (or at least above 80%).
                    Also check that your controller and mobile device batteries are adequately charged. A mid-flight
                    controller shutdown is a serious safety risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera and gimbal:</strong> Verify that the gimbal moves freely and that the camera lens is
                    clean. Remove any gimbal guards or transport clamps before takeoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Firmware:</strong> Ensure your drone's firmware is current. Never update firmware in the
                    field — do this at home with a stable internet connection. Interrupted firmware updates can "brick"
                    your drone.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory card:</strong> Confirm that a formatted memory card with sufficient space is
                    inserted. Running out of storage mid-shoot is frustrating; crashing because you were distracted
                    checking storage is dangerous.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Environment Assessment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airspace check:</strong> Verify that you're not in a restricted zone. Use apps like AirMap
                    or DJI Fly to check airspace restrictions for your location. In Lagos, pay special attention to the
                    Murtala Muhammed Airport zone and military installations.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Check wind speed, precipitation, and visibility. Most consumer drones are
                    rated for winds up to 10-12 m/s, but image quality degrades well before that limit. Avoid flying in
                    rain — water damage is not covered by most warranties.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Survey the area for power lines, trees, buildings, cranes, and other
                    obstacles. Note their positions relative to your planned flight path. Power lines are particularly
                    dangerous because they're nearly invisible from the air.</li>
                <li><strong>People:</strong> Identify areas where bystanders might be present and plan your flight to
                    maintain safe distances. Never fly directly over uninvolved people.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="article-callout">
                <h4>⚠️ The #1 Rule</h4>
                <p>If anything feels wrong — strange noises, unusual vibrations, erratic behaviour, unexpected warnings
                    — land immediately. Every experienced pilot has a story about ignoring a warning sign and regretting
                    it. Trust your instincts and land at the first sign of trouble.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Weather Safety</h2>

            <p>Weather is the most common cause of drone accidents after pilot error. Understanding how weather affects
                your drone is critical:</p>

            <h3>Wind</h3>
            <p>Wind is deceptive. Ground-level conditions often don't reflect conditions at altitude. Wind speed
                typically increases with height, and buildings create turbulent vortices that can grab your drone
                unexpectedly. As a rule of thumb:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-5 m/s:</strong> Ideal conditions. Full creative freedom.</li>
                <li><strong>5-8 m/s:</strong> Manageable for experienced pilots. Expect some image stabilisation
                    limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>8-10 m/s:</strong> Challenging. Only fly if necessary, and keep flights short and
                    controlled.</li>
                <li><strong>10+ m/s:</strong> Ground the drone. No shot is worth a crash.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rain and Moisture</h3>
            <p>Most consumer drones are NOT waterproof. Even light rain can cause electrical failures, foggy lenses, and
                corrosion. The DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise is IP45 rated (dust and light rain resistant), but standard
                consumer models like the Mavic 3 Pro, Air 3, and Mini 4 Pro have no water protection. If rain threatens,
                land immediately.</p>

            <h3>Temperature</h3>
            <p>Extreme heat reduces battery performance and can cause motors to overheat. In Lagos's tropical climate
                (typically 25-35°C), heat is generally manageable, but flying in direct midday sun for extended periods
                can push thermals. Allow the drone to cool between flights.</p>

            <h2>Battery Safety and Management</h2>

            <p>LiPo (Lithium Polymer) batteries are energy-dense and powerful, but they require careful handling:</p>

            <h3>During Flight</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never drain below 20%:</strong> Always land with at least 20% battery remaining. Below this
                    threshold, battery voltage drops rapidly and unpredictably. Plan your return-to-home flight at 30%
                    to ensure a comfortable margin.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor voltage drops:</strong> If your battery percentage drops faster than expected, land
                    immediately. Rapid voltage drops indicate a failing cell or cold-related capacity loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Account for wind on return:</strong> If you fly downwind to your filming location, you'll
                    need extra battery to fly back into the wind. Many beginners miss this and find themselves racing
                    against a depleting battery on the return journey.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Storage and Charging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Store at 40-65% charge:</strong> Never store fully charged or fully depleted batteries for
                    extended periods. Most DJI batteries automatically discharge to storage level after a few days.</li>
                <li><strong>Charge at room temperature:</strong> Never charge batteries that are hot from recent flight.
                    Allow them to cool to room temperature (25-30°C) first.</li>
                <li><strong>Use official chargers:</strong> Third-party chargers may not implement proper charge curves
                    and can damage batteries or cause fires.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect regularly:</strong> Discard any battery that shows puffing/swelling, dents, or has
                    been dropped from height.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Emergency Procedures</h2>

            <h3>Loss of Signal (Flyaway Prevention)</h3>
            <p>Before every flight, set your Return-to-Home (RTH) altitude to a value that clears all obstacles in the
                area. If the drone loses signal with the controller, it will automatically ascend to the RTH altitude
                and fly back to its takeoff point. Ensure your home point is recorded accurately (wait for a strong GPS
                lock — at least 10 satellites — before taking off).</p>

            <h3>Motor Failure</h3>
            <p>Modern DJI drones can maintain controlled flight with three motors if one fails. The drone will spin on
                its axis but maintain altitude. If you notice unusual spinning, immediately initiate a controlled
                descent to the nearest safe landing area. Do not attempt to fly horizontally — focus on a safe landing.
            </p>

            <h3>Obstacle Collision</h3>
            <p>If you clip a tree, power line, or building, assess the situation before continuing. The drone may still
                be flyable, but damaged propellers or misaligned sensors can cause a secondary crash. If the drone is
                still airborne after a collision, fly it directly back to you and land for inspection.</p>

            <h3>Low Battery Emergency</h3>
            <p>If you receive a critical low battery warning, the drone will attempt to land at its current position. If
                this position is unsafe (over water, a crowd, or private property), quickly take manual control and
                guide it to the nearest safe landing spot. Speed is essential — you may have less than 60 seconds.</p>

            <h2>Safe Flying Habits</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with the basics:</strong> Practice hovering, slow movements, and landing in an open
                    field before attempting complex shots in challenging environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Fly in open areas first:</strong> Master control in obstacle-free environments before flying
                    near buildings, trees, or crowds.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain visual line of sight:</strong> Keep the drone within your visual range at all
                    times. If you can't see it clearly, it's too far away.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't fly while distracted:</strong> Flying while tired, stressed, or under the influence of
                    alcohol impairs reaction time and decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect privacy:</strong> Don't fly over private property or film individuals without
                    consent. This protects both their rights and your legal standing.</li>
                <li><strong>Always have a spotter:</strong> When possible, fly with a companion who watches for
                    obstacles, bystanders, and other aircraft while you focus on the controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Know your drone's limits:</strong> Read the manual, understand the maximum wind resistance,
                    range, and battery life. Don't push beyond rated specifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>The safest drone pilots are the ones who fly with respect — for the technology, for the
                airspace, for bystanders, and for the limitations of their own skills. Safety isn't the opposite of fun;
                it's what makes fun sustainable.</blockquote>
